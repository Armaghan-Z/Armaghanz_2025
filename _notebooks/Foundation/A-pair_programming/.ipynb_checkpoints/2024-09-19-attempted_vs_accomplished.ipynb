    "## Attempted\n",
    "- **Exploration of Python Programming**: I focused on understanding the basics of Python, including data types, control structures, and functions. I experimented with different coding exercises to solidify my grasp on these concepts.\n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebooks**: I started using Jupyter Notebooks for coding practice, which helped me visualize data and run Python code interactively. This was particularly useful for experimenting with libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib.\n",
    "- **Version Control with Git**: I attempted to integrate Git into my workflow to manage changes in my code and collaborate with others. I practiced commands like `git commit`, `git push`, and `git pull`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accomplished\n",
    "- **Completed Python Projects**: I successfully completed several small projects, including a basic calculator and a simple data analysis script using Pandas. These projects allowed me to apply my Python skills in practical scenarios.\n",
    "- **Enhanced Jupyter Notebook Skills**: I became proficient in using Jupyter Notebooks, learning to format text, add images, and visualize data effectively. This has improved my ability to present coding work clearly.\n",
    "- **Mastered Git Basics**: I mastered the fundamental Git commands and created a GitHub repository to showcase my work. This experience enhanced my understanding of version control and collaboration in coding projects.\n",
    "- **Popup with cookies**: I was able to create a popup that remembers data by using cookies on the website, it cretes a block with text as well to warm users of the possible bug that they may encounter.\n"
